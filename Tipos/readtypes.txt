TYPES:
A type determines a set of values together with operations and methods specific to those values. A type may be denoted by a type name, if it has one, or specified using a type literal, which composes a type from existing types.

Boolean types:
A boolean type represents the set of Boolean truth values denoted by the predeclared constants true and false. The predeclared boolean type is bool; it is a defined type.

Numeric types:
A numeric type represents sets of integer or floating-point values.

String types:
A string type represents the set of string values. A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes.

Array types:
An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element type. The number of elements is called the length of the array and is never negative.
